👋 Hi, I’m Yousra Afzal

Welcome to my GitHub!

I’m an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong interest in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, focused on transforming raw data into meaningful insights and practical solutions.

I enjoy working at the intersection of data analysis, modeling, and interactive applications, using tools like Python and Streamlit to build clear, engaging, and data-driven projects. My approach is structured and curious—I aim to understand the why behind the data, not just the how.

This GitHub documents my learning journey in Data Science and AI, where I apply theory through hands-on projects, real-world datasets, and continuous experimentation. Each repository reflects my growth, problem-solving mindset, and commitment to writing clean, reproducible code.
